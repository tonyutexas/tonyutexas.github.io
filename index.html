        <h2 class="custom-h2">My work experience</h2> 
        <p class="job">By creating a Python Selenium automation program, I saved our logistic manager plenty of repetitive labor in calculating product volume and determining container size. The program also automatically compares transportation prices among three popular couriers and sends the dispatch order to the one with the best price. Additionally, it automatically collects transport expenses for every delivery, allowing our accountant to accurately calculate and predict transport expenses. It has now become an indispensable part of the rapidly-growing company!</p>
